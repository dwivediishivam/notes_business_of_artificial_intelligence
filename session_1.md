## Introduction: Getting to Know You!

Think of you as a product. If you were on a shelf in a store, what would your label say? Where you're from, your background, your hobbies, and future plans. Now, let's jazz it up! Think of you as a brand. Just like Coca-Cola has its unique identity and brand recall (you might think of their Christmas ads or the iconic bottle shape), what's YOUR unique recall? What words would friends use to describe you? That's your brand attribute!

## Why AI in Business is So Cool (and Necessary!)

AI isn't just for tech geeks. Businesses everywhere, big and small, are jumping on the AI bandwagon! Imagine Netflix using AI to suggest movies you'd like. That‚Äôs AI in business! The trick is converting this cool tech into real money-making ventures. Like, it's not just about having a fun app but making it useful and selling it. Don‚Äôt think this is just for the startup nerds. Big companies, like Google and Amazon, also grapple with integrating new tech into their models. Example: Remember Google Glass? Cool concept, but it wasn't the success Google hoped for.

## Why You Should Care About This Course

The future biz leaders need to be tech-savvy. Just as business folks need to understand tech, techies need to get business basics. It's like Batman and Robin, better together! Example: Ever heard of a tech genius with a killer app but no clue how to sell it? That's why this blend is essential. We'll steal some ideas from Stanford's courses, especially around AI organization building, innovation, and ethics. (Ethics is super important, trust me!) The whole point? Merging tech and business to master the AI business game.

## How We'll Learn (Hint: It‚Äôs Fun!)

We'll dive into real-life AI business tales from around the world. USA to Madagascar, we got it all. Books, chats, guest speakers ‚Äì the whole shebang. Your big finale? A project presentation. And hey, there are grades, just so you know. There's an exam, a quiz, class participation (so, speak up!), and a group project. Oh, and some readings from big shot authors. You might want to get a headstart on those.

## Your Ultimate Goal: Making Money with AI

Picture this. On one side, you have AI. On the other, piles of cash from happy customers. Your challenge is to bridge the two. Exciting, right?

## Journey Ahead:

1. Dive into the world of AI, how machines and humans interact, and how design plays a role. Example: Think Siri. You talk, she responds. That's human-machine interaction.
   
2. We'll dissect customer decisions, product development, and finding that sweet spot in the market. Example: Remember the first time you used Uber? It felt right, didn't it? That‚Äôs the product-market fit magic!
   
3. What‚Äôs a moat in business? Not a water-filled ditch around a castle, but something that sets you apart from competitors.

## Business 101:

- **What's a business?** Think of Apple. They make cool gadgets and software and then sell them. That's a business in action!

- **Who are customers?** They're the heroes who buy things. Without them, businesses are like fish without water. Dead fish. üêü Example: Remember the last time you ordered a pizza? To that pizza place, you were the valued customer!

- **Different customer types:**
  - **B2B** is when one business sells to another, like a software company selling a program to a corporate office.
  - **B2C** is straightforward ‚Äì businesses selling to folks like you and me. Think Amazon.
  - **B2B2C** is a fancy combo. Imagine a software company selling a fitness app to a gym, which then offers it to its members.
