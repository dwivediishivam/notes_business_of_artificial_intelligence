## The Business of Artificial Intelligence

Hey there! üòä Hope you're ready for some AI magic. This lecture is brought to you from IIIT Delhi, guided by Dr. Vinish Kathuria.

## Product Lifecycle

Think of every product like a human. It's born (introduction), grows up (growth), matures (maturity), and eventually fades away (decline). It's a circle of life, but for products! üîÑ

## Porter's Five Forces

Imagine 5 superpowers that determine the competitive intensity in an industry:

1. Threat of new entrants: New kids on the block trying to join the party!
2. Bargaining power of suppliers: If there's only one supplier selling superhero capes, they pretty much rule the game.
3. Bargaining power of buyers: Imagine customers forming a union and demanding cheaper ice creams. That's power!
4. Threat of substitute products: Ice cream too expensive? Let's have frozen yogurt!
5. Rivalry among existing competitors: It's like a soccer match. Everyone wants to score!

## üîç Deep Dive using Porter's Forces:

- **Smartphones**: Think Apple vs. Samsung vs. Google.
- **Banking**: Local banks, international giants, fintechs!
- **NLP**: Alexa vs. Siri. Who's the best chatterbox?
- **Computer Vision**: Snapchat filters or facial recognition for security? Different applications, different players.

## Competitor Analysis

Remember, competitors are basically those who satisfy the same itch. To truly understand them:

- **Streetlight Effect**: Imagine looking for keys only under the streetlight because it's easy, even if you lost them elsewhere. That's basically ignoring useful data just because some other data is easy to see.
- **Data, Data Everywhere!**
  - **Secondary sources**: Govt. files, stock filings, patents, recruitment ads, and more.
  - **Primary sources**: Direct stuff! Like feedback from customers, suppliers, even competitors. Also, user-generated content (like those reviews on Amazon).

## Strategies

Different ways companies play the game:

- **Market Leader**: The big boss in the market.
- **Market Challenger**: Trying to kick the leader off the throne.
- **Market Follower**: "If you can't beat 'em, join 'em!"
- **Market Nicher**: The smart ones who find a special corner of the market and own it.

## Niching Down

Ever heard of Peter Thiel? Big shot investor, co-founded PayPal. He suggests:

- Dominate a niche first, then look around.
- Like, if you're selling vegan ice creams in a small town, be the best at it!
- Why? Because you'll understand your niche customers wayyy better.

## Product Differentiation

It's what makes a product stand out. Jean-Philippe and Nayak say that what really sets great companies apart is their unique products.

## Competitive Strategy in AI

Remember:

- Goals: Value, value, value! Make it hard for others to copy.
- Fall in üíô with the problem, not just the tech.
- Think big, but start small.
- Work in agile, cross-functional teams.
- Partner up!

## Porter's Five Forces in AI

1. AI Foundations: Basics like infrastructure and data.
2. AI Solutions: Specific applications and use cases.
3. AI Governance: Making sure AI plays nice, ethically and securely.

## Summary of Key Points:

- Products have a lifecycle: Introduction, Growth, Maturity, Decline.
- Porter's Five Forces helps understand competition in an industry.
- Data can be sourced from primary (direct) or secondary (indirect) sources.
- Strategy in business can vary: Leading, Challenging, Following, or Niching.
- Niche markets can be profitable if done right.
- AI has its own set of competitive strategies and needs governance.

Best of luck on your exam! üçÄ Remember, AI might be smart, but you're smarter! üòâ
